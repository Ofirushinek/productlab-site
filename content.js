/* =============================================================================
   PRODUCT LAB — GATED WORKSHOP CONTENT (window.WORKSHOP_CONTENT)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the POST-workshop content vault. It renders on the gated #/prep route,
   behind the cohort password gate. app.js reads from window.WORKSHOP_CONTENT
   (below) — it does NOT hard-code this content. Loaded by a plain <script> in
   index.html BEFORE app.js, with a ?v= cache-bust.

   OFIR: THIS FILE IS YOUR SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the gated content. Edit the
   strings here to change what students see. When you edit, bump the ?v= on the
   content.js <script> tag in index.html so browsers fetch the new version.

   PROMPTS: each prompt is a template-literal string (backticks). The prompt text
   has NO backticks and NO ${...} inside it — keep it that way so you can edit
   freely without escaping. Prompts are technical text: they stay ENGLISH in both
   the HE and EN toggle states. The prompt bodies are canonical in deck.json and
   must stay byte-identical to it. Reword there first, then here.

   SECURITY NOTE: content.js ships to the browser and is publicly
   fetchable regardless of the password gate. That is FINE for these prompts —
   students receive them anyway. Do NOT put anything truly secret in this file.

   LANGUAGE: the teaching copy is BILINGUAL. The content model exists twice, under
   `en` and `he`, with identical shape. app.js picks WORKSHOP_CONTENT[lang] from
   the site toggle (fallback `en`) and sets the prep <main> direction (ltr / rtl)
   to match. The prompt BODIES stay ENGLISH in both states (technical text); only
   the labels/intros around them are translated. EN and HE both authored/approved
   by the Copywriter (parity, dash-clean). Governed by curriculum-truth.md.
